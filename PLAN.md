More Complex Combat: Implement turn-based combat, damage calculations, enemy AI, and death.
Enemy AI: More sophisticated enemy movement and attack patterns.
More Items: More varied items with different effects.
Levels: Implement level transitions and generation of different levels.
Animations: You could create simple animations using setTimeout or setInterval to rapidly change characters, but this is limited with pure ASCII.
Refactoring: As you add features, refactor the code to keep it maintainable. Consider using classes for the player, enemies, and items.
More sophisticated GUI: Use HTML elements to display player stats, enemy health, and a more elaborate inventory.
